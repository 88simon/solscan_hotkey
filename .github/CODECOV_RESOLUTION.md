# Codecov Resolution - 2025-11-12

## Issue: Codecov "404" Mystery - SOLVED ✅

### The Problem
User reported Codecov giving 404 despite:
- Token existing in GitHub secrets
- Upload logs showing success
- Configuration appearing correct

### Root Cause: Repository Name Mismatch

**Local directory name:** `solscan_hotkey`
**GitHub repository name:** `gun_del_sol`

The user was checking the wrong URL based on their local directory name!

### Evidence

**Workflow upload log:**
```
Your upload is now processing. When finished, results will be available at:
https://app.codecov.io/github/88simon/gun_del_sol/commit/af797d8d...
```

**Git remote:**
```bash
$ git remote get-url origin
https://github.com/88simon/gun_del_sol.git
```

### The Solution

**Wrong URL (404):**
```
https://codecov.io/gh/88simon/solscan_hotkey  ❌
```

**Correct URLs:**
```
https://codecov.io/gh/88simon/gun_del_sol  ✅
https://app.codecov.io/github/88simon/gun_del_sol  ✅
```

---

## Current Status: ✅ Fully Working

### Backend (gun_del_sol)
- ✅ Codecov token configured
- ✅ Uploads successful (confirmed via logs)
- ✅ Dashboard accessible at correct URL
- ✅ Coverage data processing

**Recent upload log excerpt:**
```
info - Process Upload complete
info - Your upload is now processing. When finished, results will be available at:
       https://app.codecov.io/github/88simon/gun_del_sol/commit/af797d8d...
```

### Frontend (gun-del-sol-web)
- ⚠️ Token exists but NOT configured in workflows
- ℹ️ No coverage generation setup yet
- 📋 Can be added later if needed (Jest/Vitest + Codecov)

## Files Updated

### README.md
Fixed badge URLs from `solscan_hotkey` → `gun_del_sol`:
- CI workflow badge
- Backend CI badge
- OpenAPI Schema badge
- **Codecov badge** (most important!)

**Before:**
```markdown
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/88simon/solscan_hotkey/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/88simon/solscan_hotkey)
```

**After:**
```markdown
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/88simon/gun_del_sol/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/88simon/gun_del_sol)
```

### Documentation Files
Updated all references in:
- [CODECOV_SETUP.md](CODECOV_SETUP.md)
- [BRANCH_PROTECTION_STATUS.md](BRANCH_PROTECTION_STATUS.md)

Changed all instances of:
- `88simon/solscan_hotkey` → `88simon/gun_del_sol`
- Old Codecov URLs → Correct URLs

---

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Coverage Dashboard
Visit: https://app.codecov.io/github/88simon/gun_del_sol

**Expected:** Coverage percentage, file browser, commit history

### 2. Check Badge
The Codecov badge in README should now display:
- Coverage percentage (e.g., "85%")
- Green color if coverage is good
- Links to correct dashboard

### 3. Check Future Uploads
Next time workflow runs, verify upload log still shows:
```
info - Process Upload complete
```

---

## Lessons Learned

### For Future Reference:

1. **Local directory name ≠ GitHub repository name**
   - Always check `git remote get-url origin`
   - Workflow paths show the real repo name

2. **Codecov URL structure:**
   - Old format: `https://codecov.io/gh/{owner}/{repo}`
   - New format: `https://app.codecov.io/github/{owner}/{repo}`
   - Both work, but app.codecov.io is the new UI

3. **Debugging workflow uploads:**
   - Check upload logs for the final URL
   - That URL shows where data actually went
   - Don't assume repo name from directory

4. **Badge troubleshooting:**
   - Badge URL must match repo name exactly
   - Case-sensitive!
   - 404 badge = wrong repo name or not uploaded yet

---

## Final Checklist

- [x] Identified root cause (repo name mismatch)
- [x] Verified upload is working (logs show success)
- [x] Fixed README badge URL
- [x] Updated documentation
- [x] Confirmed dashboard accessibility
- [x] Token verified working

---

## No Further Action Required

Backend Codecov integration is **fully operational**. The 404 was simply due to checking the wrong URL.
